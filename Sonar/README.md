# About the Dataset
The Sonar Dataset involves the prediction of whether or not an object is a mine or a rock given the strength of sonar returns at different angles.

It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 208 observations with 60 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows:

# What you have to do.....
## Your task are the following:
1) Data Preprocessing: Check for missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately (e.g., by imputation or removing rows with missing values). Standardize or normalize the input features to ensure that they have similar scales.
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the distribution of each feature in the dataset using histograms or density plots. Calculate and visualize the correlation matrix of the features using a heatmap to identify potential relationships.
3) Feature Visualization: Create pair plots (scatter plots) for a subset of features to visualize relationships between pairs of features, possibly using a different color for each class.
4) Feature Importance: Train a simple classifier (e.g., Decision Tree or Random Forest) and analyze feature importance to understand which features contribute the most to predicting the target class.
5) Model Selection and Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Choose and train multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) and evaluate their performance on the test set.
6) Model Evaluation: Calculate and display classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for each model. Visualize the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the best-performing model.
7) Hyperparameter Tuning: Select the best model and perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find optimal hyperparameters.
8) Final Model Visualization: Visualize the decision boundary of the final model by plotting the data points and using color gradients to indicate class probabilities.
9) Model Interpretability: Use techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or feature importance plots to explain individual predictions made by the model.
10) Discussion and Conclusion: Summarize the results obtained from different models and discuss the trade-offs between precision and recall. Conclude by highlighting the importance of feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model selection in building a successful machine learning pipeline.

# Additional Task
Balancing Classes: Since the classes are imbalanced, consider using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the class distribution.
