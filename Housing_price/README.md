# About the Dataset
The Boston House Price Dataset involves the prediction of a house price in thousands of dollars given details of the house and its neighborhood.

It is a regression problem. There are 506 observations with 13 input variables and 1 output variable. 

The variable names are as follows:

CRIM: per capita crime rate by town.
ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
INDUS: proportion of nonretail business acres per town.
CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
RM: average number of rooms per dwelling.
AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.
RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways.
TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town.
B: 1000(Bk â€“ 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
LSTAT: % lower status of the population.
MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.

# What you have to do.....
## Your task are the following:
1) Data Preprocessing: Check for missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately (e.g., by imputation or removing rows with missing values). Standardize or normalize the input features to ensure that they have similar scales.
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the distribution of each feature in the dataset using histograms or density plots. Calculate and visualize the correlation matrix of the features using a heatmap to identify potential relationships.
3) Feature Visualization: Create pair plots (scatter plots) for a subset of features to visualize relationships between pairs of features, possibly using a different color for each class.
4) Feature Importance: Train a simple classifier (e.g., Decision Tree or Random Forest) and analyze feature importance to understand which features contribute the most to predicting the target class.
5) Model Selection and Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Choose and train multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) and evaluate their performance on the test set.
6) Model Evaluation: Calculate and display classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for each model. Visualize the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the best-performing model.
7) Hyperparameter Tuning: Select the best model and perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find optimal hyperparameters.
8) Final Model Visualization: Visualize the decision boundary of the final model by plotting the data points and using color gradients to indicate class probabilities.
9) Model Interpretability: Use techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or feature importance plots to explain individual predictions made by the model.
10) Discussion and Conclusion: Summarize the results obtained from different models and discuss the trade-offs between precision and recall. Conclude by highlighting the importance of feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model selection in building a successful machine learning pipeline.

# Additional Task
Balancing Classes: Since the classes are imbalanced, consider using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the class distribution.
